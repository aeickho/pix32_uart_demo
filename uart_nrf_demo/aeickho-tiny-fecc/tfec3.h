/*
 * This is an implementation of a simple "erasure code" one can use for
 * forward error correction. The code can take n data blocks (n<=15) and
 * produce k recovery blocks (k<=3, named P for parity, Q and R). The block
 * size is a user-selectable multiple of 32 bits. But for all blocks in a
 * coding group the block size is the same. If for some reason k or less
 * blocks (including recovery blocks) are lost, tiny-fecc will be able to
 * recover all missing data blocks.
 * 
 * The mathematics is based on Linux' Raid-6 algorithm[1] which works for the
 * same reason why Reed-Solomon codes work. I changed the Galois field to be
 * smaller (to speed up multiplication and reduce the lookup table's size)
 * and added a third kind of recovery block called R. The irreducible
 * polynomial of degree 16 I used is x^16+x+1. It results in a field where
 * x (0x02) is a generator of the multiplicative group. The recovery block
 * R is computed just like Q with the order of data blocks reversed. Thus,
 * the fast encoding trick for Q described in the paper by Peter Anvin is
 * also applicable to R. P is just the parity, so it's already very fast.
 *
 * The tiny in "tiny-fecc" is supposed to reflect the size of the Galois field
 * and its consequences: a small lookup table (only 8 bytes) for reciprocals
 * and the limitation of 15 data blocks per coding group.
